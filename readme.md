#Wallapatta

Wallapatta has a syntax similar to
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and uses a layout
inspired by handouts of Edward R. Tufte.

##Overview

Wallapatta uses indentation to specify hierarchy of content.

```
###Heading1

 Introduction

 * Point one

  Description about point one

 ####Subtopic

  Subtopic content

  More subtopic content

 This belongs to Heading1
```

Indentation lets you do things like include **content within
lists**. And it helps editing large documents because standard **code
folding** can be used with Wallapatta. Also the hierarchy of content
is important for printing - to identify where to break pages.

Another key feature of wallapatta is sidenotes. You can have notes as well
as images in sidenotes.

We've changed some syntaxes of Markdown; for instance, ``<<`` and ``>>`` are
used for links instead of ``[]()``, because we felt it was a little more
intuitive (resemblence with HTML tags).
